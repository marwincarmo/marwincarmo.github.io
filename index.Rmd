## Bio

I am a second-year PhD student at the University of California, Davis. My research is centered around intra-individual variability and detection of heterogeneous variance components using Bayesian methods of inference and regularization. I am also interested in developing and refining tools for Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models. You can access my CV [here](https://marwincarmo.github.io/cv/cv-compact-v3.pdf)

A few years ago, I founded a study group focused on measurement theory in the social and behavioral sciences called [Measuring Psychology](https://measuringpsychology.netlify.app/). The group gained international attention and attracted around 250 members. As the organizer, I was in charge of facilitating our bi-weekly meetings and inviting scholars to give talks. We hosted numerous talks featuring distinguished academics in the field. Unfortunately, the group is no longer active, primarily due to my lack of time to manage it since starting my PhD. However, you can check out what we discussed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SOlgVUkUCKVM9kD9AvtMvqsG6lbsh0Nqj9Kom5eESXw/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
