# SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
\hrule
**Model selection app**. A Shiny app designed for performing simulations of statistical inferences after model selection procedures. Its purpose is to illustrate the problems that arise when model selection, parameters estimation and statistical inferences are undertaken with the same data set. [[App](https://marwin.shinyapps.io/model-selection-app/)] [[code](https://github.com/marwincarmo/model-selection-app)]

**Brazilian Research Funding app**. In this app I explore the open database of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), a Brazilian Government research funding agency.
